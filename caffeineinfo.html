<h2 style="text-align:center;color:white">What is caffeine?</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center;color:white">
Caffeine is classified as a stimulant drug. Basically, this means that it interferes with the neurons in the body and speeds up the messages sent to 
and from the brain. Is this really a bad thing? Based on a person’s weight, health and what else they’ve had that day, the effects of caffeine can vary 
greatly. Some people may feel more awake, aware and active whilst others may experience anxiety, headaches and dehydration. </h3>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:white">Does caffeine even affect sleep?</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center;color:white">
The simple answer is yes. The whole reason that people drink caffeine is because they want to stay awake. Whilst most people would think that staying 
awake longer would make you more tired and therefore sleep better later, the opposite is true. Due to the build up of adenosine (the chemical that makes 
you sleepy), drinking caffeine will interfere with the body’s ability to sleep properly and can cause disruptive sleep. </h3>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:white">How does caffeine affect health?</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center;color:white">
Consuming large amounts of caffeine can disrupt many systems in the body. For people who were assigned female at birth (AFAB) caffeine can cause the 
reproductive system to malfunction and if the person were pregnant, caffeine can cause slowed fetal growth and an increased risk of a miscarraige. Too 
much caffeine can cause muscle aches, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting as well as instability in the bowel which leads to increased urination. To minimise 
any negative effects scientists recommend consuming less than 400mg of caffeine, or even no caffeine a day.</h3>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:white">Random facts about caffeine</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center;color:white">Fully grown adults should not be consuming more than 400 mg of caffeine a day.
Caffeine can disrupt ‘slow-wave sleep’ AKA ‘deep sleep’ which is when your body is most restful.
Caffeine can be found in seeds, nuts and leaves.
Excessive consumption of caffeine can lead to anxiety, sleeping difficulties and even seizures.
Usually, caffeine does not take effect for approximately 30-60 mins.</h3>
