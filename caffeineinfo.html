<h2 >What is <span style = "color: #ff4e4e;">caffeine</span>?</h2>

<p>
	Caffeine is classified as a stimulant drug. Basically, this means that it
	interferes with the neurons in the body and speeds up the messages sent to
	and from the brain. Is this really a bad thing? Based on a person's weight,
	health and what else they've had that day, the effects of caffeine can vary
	greatly. Some people may feel more awake, aware and active whilst others may
	experience anxiety, headaches and dehydration.

<p>
	The simple answer is yes. The whole reason that people drink caffeine is
	because they want to stay awake. Whilst most people would think that staying
	awake longer would make you more tired and therefore sleep better later, the
	opposite is true. Because caffeine is an antagonist of adenosine (the
	chemical that makes you sleepy), drinking caffeine will interfere with
	the bodyâ€™s ability to sleep properly and can cause disruptive sleep.

<h2>How does <span style = "color: #ff4e4e;">caffeine</span> affect health?</h2>

<p>
	Consuming large amounts of caffeine can disrupt many systems in the body.
	For people who were assigned female at birth (AFAB) caffeine can cause the
	reproductive system to malfunction and if the person were pregnant, caffeine
	can cause slowed fetal growth and an increased risk of a miscarraige. Too
	much caffeine can cause muscle aches, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting as well
	as instability in the bowel which leads to increased urination. To minimise
	any negative effects scientists recommend consuming less than 400mg of
	caffeine, or even no caffeine a day.
