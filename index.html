	<p>Have you ever seen just how many students walk around  <span style = "color: #608DC4;"> John Monash Science School </span>

		to compare it to national averages, and inform viewers like you about our communityâ€™s caffeine habits, 
		and the adverse effects, both good and bad, that they can have on our lives.

	consumption at John Monash Science School collected
